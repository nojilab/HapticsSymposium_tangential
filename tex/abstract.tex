This study proposes a novel method of presenting force distribution in various directions with the finger mounted pin-array display.
With the method, users feel the resultant force distribution by summing up the individual forces from paired-pins which tilted differently.
We hypothesize that we can control the direction and intensity of the resultant force by only changing the air pressure applied to each pin.
Two prototype devices are made to prove the concept.
The pin inclination of one device is fixed at 45$^{\circ}$ and that of the other device is fixed at 60$^{\circ}$.
We conducted two experiments.
The result of the first experiment shows that users could discriminate the direction of the force.
The discrimination accuracy was better with the 60$^{\circ}$ device than the 45$^{\circ}$ device.
The result of the second experiment shows that users could estimate the center of friction field by friction force distribution.
% Although all participants recognized the position of the friction field, there was an average variation of 3.75 mm between the center and their estimation.
