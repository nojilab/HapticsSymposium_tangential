\section{CONCLUSIONS}

This study proposes a novel method of presenting force distribution in various direction with fixed pin-array display, in which pins are tilted.
We present users with the resultant force by summing up the individual forces from pins which tilted differently.
We hypothesize that we can control the felt direction of resultant force by only changing the air pressure applied to each pin.
We made 45$^{\circ}$ device and 60$^{\circ}$ device to prove the concept.
With this system, we conducted the Experiment 1 on  how well users can discriminate the direction of the resultant force.
JND, which is the discrimination threshold of each device, was 43.3$^{\circ}$ for the 45$^{\circ}$ device and 39.6$^{\circ}$ for the 60$^{\circ}$ device.
In addition, we conducted the Experiment 2 to investigate whether users could find a force field resorting to frictional force distribution applied by the device.
The results show that participants were able to estimate the position of the virtual friction field on the basis of force distribution from the device.
% However, the variation from the center point of friction field was larger than fingertip stimulation shift discrimination threshold.
